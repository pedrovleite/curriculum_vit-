## Professional Summary

Frontend Engineer specialized in Angular and TypeScript, with hands-on experience delivering enterprise web applications end-to-end in cross-functional teams.

I work across feature design, UI implementation, API integration, and delivery quality, with a strong focus on maintainability, performance, and scalable architecture. I’m especially effective in environments that value reusable UI systems, clear engineering standards, and close collaboration between frontend, backend, product, and UX.
